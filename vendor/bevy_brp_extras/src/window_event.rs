//! Shared helper for writing input events to both individual and `WindowEvent` channels.

//! Bevy's picking system reads `MessageReader<WindowEvent>`, while other systems read
//! individual message types like `MessageReader<CursorMoved>`. Bevy's winit integration
//! writes to both channels, so our simulated input must do the same.
